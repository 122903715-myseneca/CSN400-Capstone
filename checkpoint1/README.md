_To be completed ..._

You must then add (or if required embed) below objects into your `README.md`:
* an image
* single line code snippet
* multi line code snippet (preferably bash script)
* sample `.json` objects
* sample table
* sample hyperlink

**Take note:**
* You are allowed to work from remote though browser or from local. If you are using local, you can use any IDE of your choice, though the preferred option in this course is Microsoft VS Code.
* **Optional for this assignment** Build the habit of continuous, gradual and small updates with multiple `add` , `commit` , `push`. If a single commit has large volume of text and code added to your repository, it will raise the question of the source of the work. This exercise must have at least 6 commits.

## Submission Instructions

You need to submit below in Blackboard, follow the exact submission order:

1. A Hyperlink to your Checkpoint1. If your link does not open to `CSN400-Capstone/Checkpoint1` where I can see the `README.md`, you will receive no marks
2. Attach your `README.md` file (submit the `README.md` file not screenshots or other formats)
3. Attach single pdf file with title `CP1-student number.pdf`. If your file is not `.pdf` I will not mark it

In your 'pdf' file include below information:

1. A link to your GitHub repository root folder `CSN400-Capstone` (broken links that go nowhere if clicked, receive no marks)
2. A link to your `CSN400-Capstone/Checkpoint1` folder that contains your README.md
3. A screenshot of your `Checkpoint1/README.md` commit history
4. (Optional) Details of your last commit number to `Checkpoint1/README.md`
5. (Optional) log record of your last commit from local repository
